# CSCI 348 Socket Programming Project - Group ID: 2
## QC-LFG (Looking For Group)

### Getting Started:

1. Download & Install: 
    - Node JS: https://nodejs.org/en/
    - (recommended IDE): VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/

2. From a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory that contains the file: `server.js`

3. Run the following command to install the necessary libraries:
    - `npm install express socket.io`
    
4. Run the node server:
    - `node server.js`
    - (The server should print a listening message in the console once loaded)
    
5. Connect to the server: 
   - From the same device:
       - Using any web browser, enter  the URL:  https://localhost:3000, or https://127.0.0.1:3000
   - From another device (on the same network, if the network allows communication between devices)
       - Retrieve the current local IP address of the server host on the network
       - Using any web browser, enter the URL:  https://serverLocalIPAddress:3000

6. Bypass any security prompts in the browser (as the self signed certificate may flag the webpage as unsafe)

7. Enable Location Access to allow for real-time geolocation updates the to server
